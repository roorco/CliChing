**I-Ching for command line**

#Introduction 
I-Ching is a chinese book of wisdom, almost 3000 years old, used as well as an oracle.
It is one of the most amazing experience for me reading, study, understanding this book.
Because it describes the root of all possible life experience through its 64 hexagram, I-Ching contains 
in itself all possible stories and human situations.
