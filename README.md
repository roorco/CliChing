CliChing
========
**I-Ching for command line**

#Introduction and a bit of history
I-Ching is a chinese book of wisdom, almost 3000 years old, used as well as an oracle.
It is one of the most amazing experience for me reading, study, understanding this book.
Because it describes the root of all possible life experience through its 64 hexagram, I-Ching contains 
in itself all possible stories and human situations.
Leibniz in the late 1600 got inspeired by I-Ching in discovering binary numbers.
It seems a good exercise to me to bring back I-Ching in binary numbers.

#How to use CliChing
Cliching is a program that ask you for a question and randomly select an hexagram line by line.
Clichin will draw the resulting hexagram and printing the description and lines description in the translation of Richard Wilhelm  
It is a python2.x program, it doesn't require any dependancy and it must be exeuted by command line
  
`python cliching.py`

#Further developments
-There are several translations of I-Ching chinese text.
In the present version of this software I have used Richard Wilhelm's translation.
It is the one that I'm used to, I'm studying Alfred Huang version now, I will probably implement it in the future.
-I would like to add the possibility to browse all hexagrams instead of jumping directly to asking a question.
-Creating a conclusive file with the question and response for each consultation.
